# A Mithril project with CoffeeScript, ES6, and Stylus

Compatible with Mithril 1.x

Starter app generated with [generator-coffee-mithril](https://github.com/jhessin/generator-coffee-mithril).

## Setup

Init:

```bash
yarn
```

Start development server (port 3000):

```bash
yarn start
```

Start (and open) development server:

```bash
yarn start:open
```

If the dev server doesn't load there may be a server running already. To kill any active node server you can run (on *nix systems - not sure about windows):

```bash
yarn killall
```
