// This folder holds all of the styles for your app.
// You 'can' technically use inline styles, however you
// lose quite a bit of mithril's elegance with . and # notation
// when you do that. I chose to use stylus as it is the most
// feature rich bracketless styling languages.

// Here you can specify any postCss plugins that require options using
// postcss-use
@use autoprefixer
@use postcss-opacity
@use postcss-vmin
@use pixrem

// I use semantic-ui for much of the styling.
@require '~semantic-ui-stylus/dist/semantic.min.css'

// I've included several files to show the modularity of this system.
@require './base'
@require './home'
